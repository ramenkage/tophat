# tophat - Puzzle tracking software for Mystery Hunt team ‚òÉ
This Drupal website tracks rounds and puzzles for collaborating on puzzle hunts.
It is ***decidedly*** a work-in-progress. The code is messy, and way too much
functionality is still in the configuration, so installation on a new server
is very fiddly. That said, once it's set up, it works pretty well.

## Installation
Huge caveat: I have not attempted to reinstall from scratch recently. The steps
below should theoretically work, but this code is provided as-is, and I don't
have time to help debug. It is currently working correctly on ‚òÉ's server, so
rest assured it is possible to install. üëç

1. Clone this git repo.
1. Run `composer install` in the root tophat directory. This will install
   dependencies, including various libraries into /vendor, as well as Drupal
   core and contrib modules into /web/core and /web/modules/contrib.
